# Kemplast Process Solutions - Website Redesign

Welcome to the new Kemplast Process Solutions official website. Kemplast has been pioneering process instrumentation and industrial solutions since 1986. This project is a complete modern redesign of the website aiming to provide a premium, dynamic, and seamless experience for users browsing products, asking for quotes, or submitting career applications.

## 🎯 Objectives
- **Modern Upgrade:** Transition from a legacy design to a highly modern, animated UI.
- **Engagement:** Increase user engagement with interactive elements, floating animations, and bento-grid layouts.
- **Centralized Communications:** Unify product inquiries, quote requests, and job applications to route directly to `sales@kemplast.in`.
- **Product Integration:** Cleanly display the massive catalog of Kemplast products including the newly added Siemens PLC catalog.
- **SEO & Performance:** Ensure high performance, fast load times, and structured data representing the organization on Google and IndiaMART.

## 🏗 Architecture
This project is built on a highly scalable, modern web stack using:
- **Framework:** [Next.js 16](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Animation Framework:** Framer Motion for scroll-linked animations and page transitions.
- **Components:** Shadcn / Radix UI primitives for robust accessibility.
- **Backend/Forms:** Next.js Route Handlers coupled with `Resend` for sending emails programmatically.
- **Icons:** `lucide-react`
