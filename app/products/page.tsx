    introduction:
      "Flex-O-Seal is a unique sealing material manufactured from special grade of expanded 100% pure PTFE by transforming the fibrous structure by means of a special process. Though very tough, it is spongy and suited to almost all flanges, covers and narrow cavities. Its special soft and flexible character enables it to be the most ideal seal under pressure without significant cold flow even on irregular, badly damaged or corroded flange surfaces. Once bolted this gasket rarely need to be re-torqued.",
